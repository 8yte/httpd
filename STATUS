CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

  * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
    that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
    made in the trunk.  Note 2.2.18 contained an incompatible ABI change,
    subsequently corrected, and should not be referenced.

  * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
    as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
    get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
    branches/2.2.x, as applicable.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

  *) Rather than odds-and-ends applied out of order, proposing we revert
     r1757240, r1757256, r1757295, r1758671, r1758672, r1775232, all of
     which is now recorded in the 2.2.x-merge-http-strict branch, and
     bring that branch back into 2.2.x for 2.2.32 release.

     Roll-up patch of the above (not recommended for casual reading, these
     would be committed individually as noted above... but for only for sanity
     testing the end result. Due to intervening CHANGES/ap_mmn changes, there
     is small delta after reverting the above...)
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wrowe/patches/master/httpd-2.2-HEAD-http-protocol-strict.patch
       This patch above does *NOT* apply to the 2.2.31 release, c.f. the delta
       of the 2.2.x-merge-http-strict branch for that information. This is for
       folks who are testing rollbacks plus 2.4.x activity against 2.2.x HEAD!
       Sorry to start from scratch, but yann's correct observation was correct,
       that nothing will apply out-of-order, and everything on 2.2 branch had
       already become disordered.

       - need to rebase patch on branch to pick up one-liner changes in
         r1777178 and r1777182
     ylavic:
        httpd-2.2-HEAD-http-protocol-strict.patch + r1777178 + r1777182 worked,
        but not the former procedure (merge conflicts).
     wrowe asks: covener, would you apply? I'd like to have at least a second
                 pair of hands and eyes on merging this to branches/2.2.x and
                 am happy to compare/verify against my working copy.

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

   * mod_proxy_balancer: Always initialize the shared parameters of a load
     balancer member, even if it is already used as standalone.  PR 57067.
     2.2.x patch: http://people.apache.org/~ylavic/httpd-2.2.x-mod_proxy_balancer-lbfactor.patch
     ylavic: trunk/2.4.x not concerned, 2.2.x only.
     -1: ylavic
     ylavic: After some work on PR 44736, this patch seems to not be needed,
             each balancer has its own scorebord entry. Withdrawing for now,
             until I get a clear reproducer.

  * mod_cache: Realign the cache_quick_handler() to behave identically
    to the default_handler() when reacting to errors when writing to the
    filter stack. Stops APR errors appearing in access_log as result codes.
    Trunk patches: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1003913
    2.2.x patch: http://people.apache.org/~minfrin/httpd-mod_cache-errorfix-22.patch
    +1: minfrin
    trawick: any reason it shouldn't be completely aligned with default_handler's
             choice to return OK vs. 500?
    rpluem: Agreed with trawick. They should behave the same.

   * modules/ldap/util_ldap.c: Correct erroneous messages
     PR: 53402
     trunk and 2.4.x: Erroneous message about LDAPSharedCacheSize
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&sortby=date&revision=1096577
     trunk and 2.4.x: Erroneous order for the parameters

     2.2.x patch: attached in PR 53402 (https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=29502)
     +1: jailletc36
     -1: rjung
     rjung: the proposed 2.2 patch also changes LDAPTrustedClientCert to OR_AUTHCFG.
            This change seems to come from PR46541 which needs a bigger backport (r915660)
            Note: covener commented it in the PR as "I don't think LDAPTrustedClientCert can
            really be made usable in 2.2.".
     rjung: I don't understand what was voted on, the backport of both revisions
            or only the PR attachment. The latter is only about r627637.
     covener: withdrawing my vote, I reviewed the attachment but missed the OR_AUTHCFG change.
    jailletc36: Sorry for confusion. OR_AUTHCFG changes was not intentional. This is linked to
                r915660 on trunk, before the 2.4 branch. I copy-pasted the AP_INIT block from
                trunk, without seeing this change.

    the path specified by the Include directive.

    +1: minfrin, jim, poirier
    -1: wrowe [This introduces new invalid paths which do not resolve to any
               configuration file paths, increasing the probability of unreported
               syntax errors to further confuse the administrator.]

  * srclib/pcre and vendor/pcre
    http://www.vuxml.org/freebsd/pkg-pcre.html

    update to pcre-7.8
    outcome: remove from trunk, leave alone in branches/2.2.x and branches/2.0.x

 * core, authn/z: Avoid calling access control hooks for internal requests
   with configurations which match those of initial request.  Revert to
   original behaviour (call access control hooks for internal requests
   with URIs different from initial request) if any access control hooks or
   providers are not registered as permitting this optimization.
   Introduce wrappers for access control hook and provider registration
   which can accept additional mode and flag data.  Convert common
   provider version strings to macros.
   The core purpose of this pile of patches is to avoid unnecessary
   authn/z hooks when a single request spawns large numbers of internal
   requests to which an identical set of httpd configurations apply.
   This permits modules such as mod_authn_dbd and mod_dav to work together
   acceptably.
   Because certain external modules such as mod_authz_svn rely on the old
   behaviour, this optimization can be made only when all authn/z hooks and
   providers are registered with the appropriate flag.
   It would be excellent if Windows and NetWare people could ensure this
   builds correctly.
   In particular, mod_auth.h must be included into request.c and I've left
   mod_auth.h under modules/aaa rather than try to replicate wrowe's work
   in trunk moving all the include files around.
   I'm open to suggestions that this remain in trunk only, but in that case,
   it would be very helpful to know whether most people expect a 2.4 branch
   or just a 3.0 branch to be next.  If 3.0, some of the backwards
   compatibility work could potentially be ditched.

   wrowe:     It would seem we only need to test for X_OK?

 * mod_disk_cache: Decline the opportunity to cache if the response is
    a 206 Partial Content. This stops a reverse proxied partial response
    from becoming cached, and then being served in subsequent responses.

    niq asks: I can see the logic of not cacheing partial responses,
    but why should mod_disk_cache worry about them if mod_cache allows
    them, as in the following proposal?
    rpluem says: As poirier correctly mentions, the same must be done for mod_mem_cache
    as well.

  *) mod_cache: Explicitly allow cache implementations to cache a 206 Partial
     Response if they so choose to do so. Previously an attempt to cache a 206
     was arbitrarily allowed if the response contained an Expires or
     Cache-Control header, and arbitrarily denied if both headers were missing.

                 committed.

     minfrin: r1055246 needs to be added to r1052314 to ensure the cleanup

                  r1052314, r1055246 and r1055570 (Comment fix by Jim)?

  * cross-compile: allow to provide CC_FOR_BUILD so that gen_test_char will be
    compiled by the build compiler instead of the host compiler.
    Also set CC_FOR_BUILD to 'cc' when cross-compilation is detected.
    Since PCRE is included with 2.2.x this patch also takes care for dftables.
